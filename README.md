Perl Weekly to Kindle

At the moment there's nothing to see here yet.

## Excuses

I took the opportunity of starting something from scratch to try one of the 
perl CLI application frameworks (and then subsequently decided to go for the
Moose one). Sorry if this makes my application harder to install than it 
should ;)

## Installing

### Requirements

* MooseX::App::Cmd

  * On fedora: yum install perl-MooseX-App-Cmd
  * Otherwise: cpan MooseX::App::Cmd (?)
